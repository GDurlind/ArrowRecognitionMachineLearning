# ArrowRecognitionMachineLearning
Training a robot's visual recognition abilities using machine learning models and datasets filled with pictures of arrows.

This code involves the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks to control the movement of a differential robot within CoppeliaSim. The CNN uses input from a vision sensor to recognise four separate classes: moving forwards, moving backwards, turning left, and turning right. Learning models are then required to train the robot to recognise arrows which will correspond to each of the four classes. These machine learning models are then optimised and trained on a set of pre-existing data which will form the underlying functionality of the robot as it recognises these arrows in real-time.
